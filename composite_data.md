  * Understand how larger chunks of data are stored in a program
  * Understand how to access these larger chunks of data
  * Understand the most common data chunks, arrays
</details>

So far we have been working only with _atomic_ data.  That is data that is "just one thing" and can't be broken up.  This is getting unwieldy.  Everytime we have something to draw, we need to have an x-position and a y-position and so we need two variables for something we probably think of as just one thing (the position on the screen).

Wouldn't it be nice to have just one variable for both?  Yes, yes it would.  

The facility we need for this is _composite data_.  We need a way to put two values (the x and the y positions) into a single variable.  What type would this be?  Not an `int` or a `float` or a `char`!  Processing _does_ have types we can use for this, but they act a little differently from the types we already know.

Let me introduce you to one of these types, `PVector`.  

Recall that processing has _values_ (like 1,c,4.5) that are grouped into _types_ (like `int`, `char`, `float`).  It is possible to have a value with two numbers in it, that value would be of the type `PVector`:

  * (1,1) is a `PVector` with two values in it, `1` and `1`
  * (10,4) is a `PVector` with two values in it, `10` and `4`.

So you can see that we have a whole new type and a whole new set of values that fit into that type.  Lets play with it.

[The Processing website has an example of using `PVectors`](https://processing.org/examples/bouncingball.html) for a bouncing ball program.  Study it carefully.

You will notice two interesting features that we will now discuss:

  * the use of "dot-notation" to get inside the compound data
  * the use of `new` for an extra step in the declare-and-initialise process.

## Compound Data in Memory

So, compound data is _bigger_, so much so, that it can't fit into a single memory slot.  _But_ variables can only point to single buckets, so what do we do?

For compound data, a variable will point to one memory location that then tells you _where the larger chunk of memory is_.
<aside markdown="1">
Note that the reasons for this way of doing things are myriad.  In the end, it is the right way but we don't need to know all the reasons, we only need to know that it is so and know how to work with it.  Atomic data (`int`, `float`, `char`) is stored directly in their memory slot but compound data stored a "reference" to another location where the compound data is really stored.

So, an extra step is required, making the memory box point to another, larger, chunk of memory.  This is what `new` does.  It finds some free space that is big enough, and sets aside that much space.  Lets call this step "memory allocation".

The other new step is to "follow the arrow" from the memory box to the bigger chunk and to pull out one part from there.  This is what the `.` does.  It follows the arrow and then uses the special name that comes after to get one of the values from the larger chunk.  Lets call this step "de-referencing".

Processing actually has two different forms of compound data - objects like `PVector` (and many others), and arrays.  We will focus on arrays from here but feel free to use objects whenenver you like.

Note:  objects are often taught with a related concept - classes - however, we will not address classes in any way at this point.

Note that the two different versions of compound data come with two different syntaxes for dereferences - for objects is it `.name` and for arrays it is `[number]`.  See below for details.

# Arrays

To understand how to use compound data, we will look at the most common compound data type, arrays.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NptnmWvkbTw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

An array is a fixed-sized collection of items, each item of the same type.

So you can have,

- an array of 5 integers
- an array of 20 booleans
- an array of 2000 characters
- an array of 50 Strings
- an array of 400 arrays
- and so on...


## Syntax to create an array

There are a few ways to create an array.

### Creating array - Option 1

The most common way to create an array is by specifying the type and size of the array.

```java
type[] arrayName = new type[size];
```

#### Example

```java
int[] arr = new int[5]; //an array that holds 5 integers
```

```java
boolean[] flags = new boolean[8]; //an array that holds 8 booleans
```

### Creating array - Option 2

When you know the values that need to be stored in the array beforehand, you can create an array as,

```java
type[] arrayName = {item1, item2, ....};
```

#### Example

```java
int[] cutoffs = {50, 65, 75, 85};
```

```java
char[] punctuations = {'.', '!', '?', ',', ';', ':'};
```

# Size of an array

The number of items in an array `arr` is given by `arr.length`.

<div class="aside" markdown="1">
Note that, given what we said above this means `.length` should be read as "follow the reference and see how large the chunk of memory at the other end is".
</div>

For example,

```java
int[] data = new int[20];
println(data.length); //displays 20
```

# Accessing items of an array

- The first item of an array `arr` is at index 0.
- The second item of an array `arr` is at index 1.
- ...
- The last item of an array `arr` is at index `arr.length - 1`.

Thus you can traverse an array using a loop from `0` to `arr.length - 1` as,

```java
for(int i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
	//do what you want with arr[i]
}
```

#### Example

Create an array that holds the outcome of 20 dice rolls.

Each dice roll is a random integer between 1 and 6.

```java
int[] outcomes = new int[20];
for(int i=0; i < outcomes.length; i++) {
	outcomes[i] = (int)random(1, 7); //remember 7 is not included
}
```

Then we can find out the average outcome as,

```java
int total  = 0;
for(int i=0; i < outcomes.length; i++) {
	total += outcomes[i];
}
double average = (total * 1.0)/outcomes.length;
//multiplication with 1.0 to convert int to double
```


# Storage of an array and representation

For the next example, note that an integer takes up 4 bytes of memory.

The array items are held together in a block.

Consider the following array,

```java
int[] arr = new int[4];
```

If the first item is at memory address 200-203, the second item will be at 204-207, the third item will be at 208-211 and the last item from 212-215.

The array itself holds the starting address, in this case 200.
That's why we say that an array is a *reference*.

We represent this as,

<div>
<center><img src="arraysFigs/arrays-figure0.png" style="width: 300px;"></center>
</div>

or a more simplified way of adding the array label above the items.

<div>
<center><img src="arraysFigs/arrays-figure1.png" style="width: 100px;"></center>
</div>

#### Example

```java
boolean[] flags = {true, false, false, true, false};
```

</div>


# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Draw the memory diagram for the following code,

```java
int[] data = new int[]{50, 90, 30, 20, 60};
```

## Exercise 2

Draw the memory diagram for the following code,

```java
int[] data = new int[6];
for(int i=0; i < data.length; i++) {
	if(i%2 == 0) {
		data[i] = 2*i+1;
	}
	else {
		data[i] = -3*i;
	}
}
```

## Exercise 3

Write a piece of code that creates the arrays represented in the following diagram.

<div>
<center><img src="arraysFigs/arrays-figure7.png" style="width: 300px;"></center>
</div>

## Exercise 4

Draw the memory diagram for the following code,

```java
int[] a = {4,8,15,16,23,42};
int[] b = a;
b[2] = 100;
b = new int[]{104,101,108,108,111};
```

## Exercise 5

Write a piece of code that creates an array with 100 integers, each between 1 and 20. Count the number of items that are divisible by the item after them.

For example, if the first few items of the array are `{20, 5, 8, 4, 4, ...}`, 20 is divisible by 5, 8 is divisible by 4, and 4 is divisible by 4, so we have 3 such items so far.

## Exercise 6

Consider the following piece of code.

```java
int[] items = new int[10];
items[0] = 1;
for(int i=1; i < items.length; i++) {
	items[i] = 2 * items[i-1];
}
```

What are the contents of the array `items`?

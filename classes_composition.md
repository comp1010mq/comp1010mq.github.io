# Composition

Consider the following class `Point`:

```java
public class Point {
	public int x, y;
	public Point(int _x, int _y) {
		x = _x;
		y = _y;
	}
}
```

Next, consider class `Line`:

```java
public class Line {
	public Point start, end;
	public Line(Point p1, Point p2) {
		start = p1;
		end = p2;
	}
}
```

Pay attention to the following statement very carefully!

Each **instance** of class `Line` holds **references** to two **instances** of class `Point`.

(Informally, we say, *each Line contains two Point objects*)

If I create an object of `Line` as:

```java
Point p = new Point(10, 40);
Point q = new Point(70, 60);
Line line = new Line(p, q);
```

There are 5 references and 3 instances.

References (and types):

1. `line`: `Line`
2. `line.start`: `Point`
3. `line.end`: `Point`
4. `p`: `Point`
5. `q`: `Point`

Instances (and types):

1. instance to which `line` refers: `Line`
2. instance to which `p` and `line.start` refer: `Point`
3. instance to which `q` and `line.end` refer: `Point`

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

One can also create anonymous objects thereby reducing the number of references to keep track of.

```java
Line line = new Line(new Point(10, 40), new Point(70, 60));
```

## Adding methods to the mix

Consider a slightly modified class definition of `Point`.

```java
public class Point {
	public int x, y;

	public Point(int _x, int _y) {
		x = _x;
		y = _y;
	}

	public double distanceFromOrigin() {
		return Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y);
	}

	public int compareTo(Point other) { //compare based on distance from origin
		double d1 = this.distanceFromOrigin();
		double d2 = other.distanceFromOrigin();
		if(d1 > d2)
			return 1;
		if(d1 < d2)
			return -1;
		return 0;
	}
}
```

We can then update the class `Line` to get the point on the line that is further from the origin, as,

```java
public class Line {
	public Point start, end;

	public Line(Point p1, Point p2) {
		start = p1;
		end = p2;
	}

	public Point getPointFurtherFromOrigin() {
		/*
		 * left for you as an exercise
		 * return p1 or p2 based on whichever is further from the origin
		 * return p1 if they are both equidistant from the origin
		 */
	}
}
```


# Homework - 1

### Task 1

Draw the memory diagram for the objects created inside the `main` method in the following code. Also, state the number of instances and references in the diagram.

```java
class Date {
  public int day, month, year;

  public Date(int d, int m, int y) {
  		date = d;
  		month = m;
  		year = y;
  	}
}

class Time {
  public int hour, minute, second;

  public Time(int h, int m, int s) {
  		hour = h;
  		minute = m;
  		second = s;
  	}
}

class DateTime {
  public Date date;
  public Time time;

  public Date(Date d, Time t) {
  		date = d;
  		time = t;
  	}
}

public class Client {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Date d1 = new Date(26, 5, 2020);
    Time t1 = new Time(19, 54, 0);
    DateTime dt1 = new DateTime(d1, t1);
  }
}
```

### Task 2

Draw the memory diagram for the objects created inside the `main` method in the following code. Also, state the number of instances and references in the diagram.

```java
class Date {
  public int day, month, year;

  public Date(int d, int m, int y) {
  		data = d;
  		month = m;
  		year = y;
  	}
}

class Time {
  public int hour, minute, second;

  public Time(int h, int m, int s) {
  		hour = h;
  		minute = m;
  		second = s;
  	}
}

class DateTime {
  public Date date;
  public Time time;

  public Date(Date d, Time t) {
  		date = d;
  		time = t;
  	}
}

class QuizAttempt {
  public DateTime start, end;
  public int marksObtained;

  public QuizAttempt(DateTime s, DateTime e, int m) {
  		start = s;
  		end = e;
  		marksObtained = m;
  }
}

public class Client {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Date d1 = new Date(26, 5, 2020);
    Time t1 = new Time(19, 54, 0);
    DateTime dt1 = new DateTime(d1, t1);
    Date d2 = new Date(27, 5, 2020);
    Time t2 = new Time(01, 13, 40);
    DateTime dt2 = new DateTime(d2, t2);
    QuizAttempt attempt = new QuizAttempt(dt1, dt2, 40);
  }
}
```

### Task 3

For the same code as task 2, write down statements that store the following values in variable of the correct type.

- The date on which the attempt began.
- The time at which the attempt ended.
- The minute at which the attempt began.
- The hour at which the attempt ended.
- The marks obtained in the attempt.
- Assuming the existence of the following method in class `DateTime`, the number of seconds taken for the attempt

	```java
	public int getSecondsTo(DateTime other) {
		//returns number of seconds between calling object
		//and parameter object. returned value is positive if
		//parameter object is after calling object in
		//the chronological sense.
	}
	```

TASK 1
fill in the body to the function isDigit such that when passed 
a char, the function returns true if the character is a 
digit and false otherwise.

some parameter-return value mappings:
'a' -> false
'0' -> true
'7' -> true
';' -> false

  TASK 2 
  compute whether the character '8' is a digit and store it

  compute whether the character '9' is a digit and store it
  in a boolean variable k.
  
  compute whether the character '!' is a digit and store it
  in a boolean variable l.
  
  compute whether the character 'w' is a digit and store it
  in a boolean variable m.
  
  compute whether the character '0' is a digit and store it
  in a boolean variable n.
  
  once completed, run your program and check the console
  to see whether you have successfully completed both tasks.

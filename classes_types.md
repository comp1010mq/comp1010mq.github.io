## Author: Gaurav Gupta

We have seen quite a few different types that data can be:

  * `int` for simple numbers
  * `boolean` for true/false
  * `float` for more precise numbers
  * `String` for text
  * `PVector` for two or three numbers bundled up
  * arrays for many values bundled up

We have also seen that these are split into primitive/value types (`int`, `boolean`, `float`, etc) and compound/reference types (`String`, `PVector`, arrays).

But what if we want to make our own types?

To warm-up, lets see a situation where a custom type might help.

There are 11 players in my soccer team and we want to track the number of shots taken by each player during the season, number of goals scored, and the number of red cards they get.  So, for each player I need to store a `String` for their name, and three `int`s for their shots, goals, and red cards.  With what I have now, I might consider the following variables.

~~~~~
String[] names;
int[] shots;
int[] goals;
int[] redCards;
~~~~~

If you have done something like this before, you know it can be hard to keep everything in order.  Player 0 has values in three different arrays, all at slot 0 (hopefully).  It would be easier if there was a `Player` type that could store one `String` and three `int`s, then we could define

~~~~~
Player[] players
~~~~~

You might have experienced this benefit when using `PVector`s back in your Processing days.

# Classes are Custom Types

In Java, you can create this custom type with a _class_.

~~~~~
public class Player {
	public String name;
	public int goals;
	public int shots;
	public int redCards;
}
~~~~~

You should be thinking at this point "but how do I make values of this type?".  I make an `int` with a number (`1`), I make a `String` with inverted commas, I make a `PVector` with `PVector(1,2)`.  This last example is your clue!

All custom types are reference types and follow the same rules as other reference types:

  * You need an allocation step with `new`
  * You use the name of the type to create values, passing in necessary parameters.

In the case of our custom type, the "necessary parameters" are the `String` and three `int`s

## Jargon: Instance Variables

The variables we declare in our custom type are called "instance variables".  They are still variables, and they act just like the primitive variables we know and love, but to distinguish them (because they can do some special things), we give them a special name.

This means we say "you construct a value of a custom type by giving the name of the type and each of the instance variables".

~~~~~
Player player;
player = new Player("Gaurav", 1, 26, 0);
~~~~~

# Why `public`?

Classes can also act to "encapsulate" things, which is dealt with later.  So you have to be explicit in saying that the instance variables of a class are available to everyone else by declaring them `public`.  We won't concern ourselves with the alternatives yet.

## Jargon: Object

We have avoided the term so far, but now it is time to embrace it.  Any value created in a reference type is called an "object".  So `player` and `name` are both objects.  We say `player` is an object of type `Player` and `name` is an object of type `String`.  All objects are values (which was the name we used for them until now).  Just as instance variables are like variables with extras, objects are values with extras - we will see the extras soon.

# Defining class and creating objects

## Defining classes


-   Each class is defined in a separate file with the same name and
    ending with `.java`

-   All Java class definitions are separate files in the same folder
    (for now).

## Adding instance variables

Instance variables can be declared as in the following two examples.
Note the `public` modifier (for now):

```java
 public int     instanceVar1;
 public String  instanceVar2;
```

## Example - Defining a class

```java
public class Rectangle {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}
```

Note that the above class definition merely
provides a template or blueprint for the class. No complete program
using this class has yet been written, and no object (instance) of this
class has yet been created.

     public double radius;
     /*
     * note that int is a wrong choice as radius
     * CAN be a floating-point value like 1.5 or 2.4
     */
 }
 ```

## Declaration and instantiation

### Declaration

Declaration creates a *reference* in the memory, which doesn’t refer to
any storage space yet.

An object of the new class type is declared in main as follows:

```java
ClassName  classVar; //declaration
```

In the following example, `r` is an object of class `Rectangle1`.

```java
Rectangle r; //example
```

![](./fig/03-classes-and-objects/classesObjects1-figure2.png)

### Instantiation

We create an instance that holds the instance variables and the object holds its address. We say that the object refers to the instance, and represent it by an arrow going from the object to the instance.

```java
classVar = new ClassName(); //instantiation
```

In the following example, `new Rectangle()` creates an instance (the green block in the diagram following the code) and the object `r` refers to it.

```java
r = new Rectangle(); //example
```

![](./fig/03-classes-and-objects/classesObjects1-figure3.png)

### Combining declaration and instantiation

```java
ClassName classVar = new ClassName();
//declaration + instantiation

Rectangle r = new Rectangle(); //example
```
<div class="task" markdown="1">
Declare and instantiate an object `myCircle` of class `Circle`.
<details class="solution" markdown="1"><summary>solution</summary>```java
 public class Client {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         Circle myCircle = new Circle();
     }
 }
 ```
Although, you can just write the relevant part in written exams:
```java
Circle myCircle = new Circle();
```

## The dot (.) operator

The dot operator gives us access to the members (instance variables and
methods) for an object. Think of it as the `apostrophe s (’s)` of the
human language (as in *"Gaurav’s class"* or *"Matt’s workshop"*)

```java
Rectangle r = new Rectangle(); //example
r.width = 5;
```

-   The expression `r` gives us access to the instance variable `width`
    of object `r`.

<div class="task" markdown="1">
Write a piece of code that sits outside the class definition and displays the radius of the object `myCircle`
<details class="solution" markdown="1"><summary>solution</summary>
 ```java
 System.out.println(radius);
 ```
</details>
</div>

## Are there any default values?

-   Each *instance variable* is automatically initialised
    to the default value for its type when an object of the class is
    created.

-   For example, an instance variable of type `int` is given the default
    value 0;

-   And an instance variable of type `String` (or any class type) is
    given the default value `null`. (More about `null` later.)

# I wish creating objects was easier (aka constructors)

Let’s say that the user wants to create a `Rectangle` whose `width` is 5
and `height` is 8. The following code achieves this,

```java
Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
r.width = 5;
r.height = 8;
```

However, it would be really nice if one could pass the values for the
instance variables in the instantiation statement itself, as,

```java
Rectangle r = new Rectangle(5, 8);
```

This is done through `constructors`.

## Constructors

-   A constructor is a special function defined in the class.

-   A constructor must have the same name as the class.

-   A constructor has no return type (not even void).

-   There may be multiple constructors, each distinguished by its
    parameter list. Thus, we may have one constructor with no
    parameters, and another with one `int` parameter.

-   A suitable constructor is automatically called during instantiation
    based on number of parameters passed. If an appropriate constructor
    is not found, a compilation error is generated.

## Example - Constructors

```java
public class Rectangle {
    public double width, height;

    public Rectangle() { //default constructor
        width = 1;
        height = 1;
    }

    //parameterized constructor for a square
    public Rectangle(double side) {
        width = side;
        height = side;
    }

    //parameterized constructor - generic
    public Rectangle(double w, double h) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }
}
```
## Constructors should initialise all the instance variables

This is your one chance to get some sensible values into those instance variables.  After this, the object is created and other code might try to use the values in the instance variables, so put _something_ in every one.

## Default constructor

It should be noted that a default constructor (without any parameters)
is pre-defined for you by Java and that’s why you can instantiate
objects without defining it yourself.

```java
Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
```

The default constructor assigns the default values for the appropriate
data types to the instance variables. However, once you define a
parameterized constructor, the built-in default constructor is taken
away by Java. Thus, if you want to construct an object with default
initial values for the instance variables, you need to re-define that!

## Defining the default constructor

Let’s say the default `Rectangle` instance should be of unit length. We
can define the default constructor as,

```java
public Rectangle() {
    length = 1;
    breadth = 1;
}
```

<div class="task" markdown="1">
Add a default constructor to the class `Circle` that assigns the value 1.0 to instance variable `radius`.
<details class="solution" markdown="1"><summary>solution</summary>
 ```java
 //default constructor
 public Circle() {
     radius = 1;
 }
 ```
</details>
</div>

<div class="task" markdown="1">
Add a parameterized constructor to the class `Circle` that assigns the value of the parameter passed to instance variable `radius`.
<details class="solution" markdown="1"><summary>solution</summary>
 ```java
 //parameterized constructor
 public Circle(double r) {
     radius = r;
 }
 ```
</details>
</div>

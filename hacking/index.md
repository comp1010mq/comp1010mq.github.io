title: Research Skills
---

We are going to cover (in a fun way) some skills needed to become an independent software researcher.  We do it by hacking away at a games console, but the skills are the main thing:

  * ability to use command line
  * ability to work in constrained environment
  * ability to work with git
  * ability to work with complex code

All of this is to set you up to work in research if that turns out to be something that interests you (and perhaps to show you how interesting it is).  We expect readers of this course to be very early on in their learning journey, maybe never having thought of research before.

As a warm-up, here are non-computer people talking about their path to research
